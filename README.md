# Arrays and Strings in C++

## AIM  
To understand and implement arrays and strings in C++, exploring their characteristics, operations, and common algorithms for efficient data manipulation.

## THEORY

### Arrays
An **array** is a collection of elements of the same data type stored contiguously in memory. It allows multiple values under a single variable name, accessible by zero-based indices.

- Fixed size known at compile time  
- Homogeneous data type  
- Efficient indexed access  

### Strings
A **string** is a sequence of characters terminated by a null character (`'\0'`). C++ supports:

- **C-style strings**: Character arrays ending with `'\0'`  
- **`std::string` class**: Safer, flexible string handling from the Standard Library

## Common Operations

| Operation      | Arrays                              | Strings                               |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Traversal      | Using loops (`for`, `while`)         | Using loops or string methods          |
| Search         | Linear or binary search algorithms   | `find()`, `find_first_of()` etc.       |
| Modification   | Element assignment by index          | Modify characters or use string methods|
| Concatenation  | Manual element copying               | `strcat()` (C strings), `+` or `append()` |
| Sorting        | Standard algorithms like `sort()`    | Sorting characters or string arrays    |

## Best Practices and Optimization Tips

- Always ensure array bounds are respected to avoid undefined behavior.  
- Prefer `std::string` over C-style strings for safety and convenience.  
- Minimize copying large arrays or strings; use references or pointers where applicable.  
- Use standard library algorithms (`<algorithm>`) for sorting and searching to leverage optimized implementations.  
- For large datasets, consider dynamic arrays (`std::vector`) instead of fixed-size arrays.

## Algorithm

### Calculate Sum and Average of Marks

1. **Start**  
2. Declare an integer `n = 6`  
3. Declare and initialize an array:  
   `marks[n] = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600}`  
4. Set `key = 400` to search  
5. Initialize `sum = 0`, `avg`  
6. Loop `i` from 0 to `n-1`:  
   - If `marks[i] == key`, print index and break  
7. Loop `j` from 0 to `n-1`:  
   - Add `marks[j]` to `sum`  
8. Calculate average as `avg = sum / n`  
9. Display `sum` and `avg`  
10. **End**

---

### Find Maximum in an Array

1. **Start**  
2. Input an array `arr[]` and size `n`  
3. Initialize `max = arr[0]`  
4. Loop from `i = 1` to `n-1`:  
   - If `arr[i] > max`, set `max = arr[i]`  
5. Print the maximum value  
6. **End**

---

### Reverse a String (Without Using `reverse()` Function)

1. **Start**  
2. Declare strings: `str1`, `str2`  
3. Input string into `str1`  
4. Calculate length `n = str1.length()`  
5. Loop `i` from `n - 1` to `0`:  
   - Print `str1[i]`  
6. **End**

---

### Check if a String is a Palindrome

1. **Start**  
2. Declare `a` for input, `revstr` for reversed string  
3. Input string into `a`  
4. Get length using `a.length()`  
5. Loop from `i = length - 1` to `0`:  
   - Append `a[i]` to `revstr`  
6. Compare `a` and `revstr`:  
   - If equal → Print "It is a palindrome"  
   - Else → Print "It is not a palindrome"  
7. **End**

## CONCLUSION

Arrays and strings are fundamental data structures in C++ programming. Understanding their properties and mastering operations such as traversal, searching, modification, and concatenation enables programmers to manipulate data efficiently. Using loops and standard algorithms helps in solving complex problems, such as calculating averages, finding maximum values, reversing strings, and checking palindromes. Adhering to best practices like boundary checking, preferring `std::string` over C-style strings, and leveraging the Standard Template Library ensures safe, clean, and optimized code. Mastery of arrays and strings forms a strong foundation for advanced programming concepts and real-world applications.
